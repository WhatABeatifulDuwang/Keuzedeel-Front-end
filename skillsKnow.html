                <h2>Scrum:</h2>
                <p>
                    Scrum is a work process, which is very common in a lot of companies and workflows. Having experience working with this process definitely makes me a great asset to any company.

                <h2>Git:</h2>
                <p>
                    Git is an essential tool for version control. I do have a bit of experience with the command line, but I find the most comfort in the use of GitHub and GitKraken.

                <h2>MySQL and XAMPP:</h2>
                <p>
                    To connect the website with a database is something I could do as well. I can write various types of SQL commands in MySQL. Connecting a database shouldn't be much of a problem either. I can also use the application XAMPP to host a database locally.

                <h2>Communication languages:</h2>
                <p>
                    As someone who lives in the Netherlands, I can fluently speak Dutch. I am also proficient in English and can speak a little bit of Chinese. Communication shouldn't be a problem with my skill set of languages.
