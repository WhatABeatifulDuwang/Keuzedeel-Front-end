                <h2>Skills:</h2>
                <p>
                    As an IT student I generally know a few programming languages and frameworks.
                    There are a lot of programming languages and other skills you can master as a programmer.
                    To make it simple, I will break down the skills I got on both IT related and non-IT related skills.
                    You will also see a chart I made with my proficiency in different kind of programming languages.

                <h3>Scrum:</h3>
                <p>
                    First of all we have Scrum.
                    Scrum is a work process, which is very common in a lot of companies and workflows.
                    Having experience working with this process definitely makes me a great asset to any company.
                    Aside from that, Scrum is also a good way to keep progress documented, and it makes sure everyone in the team contributes to the project.

                <h3>Git:</h3>
                <p>
                    Git is an essential tool for version control.
                    It is if not the most known and most used application for managing version control and sharing code with fellow developers.
                    To break Git down, there are several methods to use Git.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can use Git on the command line with either Windows Powershell or on Command Prompt.
                    GitHub is a website where you can host, download, share your project.
                    GitKraken is an application used to easily manage the projects from GitHub.
                    I do have a bit of experience with the command line, but I find the most comfort in the use of GitHub and GitKraken.

                <h3>MySQL and XAMPP:</h3>
                <p>
                    MySQL is a database management system, where project teams can create a storage filled with data.
                    The use of a database is to easily manage information without overloading your website by not storing the data in the website itself.
                    I do have experience connecting my website to a database, which is always a plus.
                    I can also write various types of SQL commands in MySQL.
                </p>
                <p>
                    XAMPP is an application you can download on your local computer if it is a Windows device.
                    It is used to host a local project, and it can host a local database as well.
                    XAMPP is a great environment to work in for testing your website before launching it online.
                    I will say I am well versed in XAMPP myself, since I host a lot of my projects locally.

                <h3>Communication languages:</h3>
                <p>
                    As someone who lives and grew up in the Netherlands, I can fluently speak Dutch.
                    I am using Dutch frequently between friends, colleagues and customers at work.
                    I am also proficient in English by studying English at school and using it a lot online on either games or social media.
                    My parents are from China, so I got taught a bit of Chinese since I was little.
                    I often speak Chinese with relatives and other close friends of my parents'.
                    So I can firmly say, communication should not be a problem with my skill set of languages.
